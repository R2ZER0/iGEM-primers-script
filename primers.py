# How to use: copy and paste these two bits of text into a program called IDLE (search for it on the uni system)
# Each needs to be in front of arrows (>>>) which tell you where IDLE starts
# then type "primer('sequence goes here')". Press enter.
# currently it doesn't put DR and UR on the same line as their prefixes and suffixes. Not sure why
# To confirm the primers fit where they should, use ApE's alignment tool

    ## ^ easy thing to be caught out on, this actually means:
    ##   if (s[-37:-35] == ‘tag’) or (‘cta’): 
    ## ‘or’ works solely with boolean logic, and in python all non-empty strings
    ##  are True (noidea why), so this if statement can never fail!

                rc(s, -36, -3)
        # if tag or cta, take one base from the start, give df with prefix
    else:
        print 'codons fine, DF is ta' + s[-37:]
        print 'DR is TAGta'
        rc(s, -37, -3) # this will take DF, take 3 from the end, and produce its complement. 
#ALso cool would be to get it run batches of sequences, and, most helpfully, remove the whitespace from sequences copied and pasted from the registry, because that’s a hassle
